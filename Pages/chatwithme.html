    <p>
        What's up dudes, to whomever may be reading this, friends, family, 
        hopefully some recruiters (but most likely just my roommates who will make fun of me),
        welcome to my website.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is technically the first real website I have ever made. It will later on feature all of past, current, and 
        future projects, but this website, in of itself, will also act as my digital face to the world. This face will
        be getting more and more attractive as I learn more and more about web development (hopefully reaching a point 
        where I can manageably make my own full stack web app). As I begin, this website is only a barebones HTML + CSS
        page, but as I improve, I will be adding Javascript functionalities, really cool css features, and if I can think
        of a relevant application, maybe backend too. These changes that I have made can be easily tracked in this project's 
        public github :).

    </p>
    <p>
        
        In any case, this is my website!!!! Recruiters, don't be scared of my dashing looks, and to Leo and Achal, I pray
        you two may never find this page ðŸ¥¶. I hate linkedin so I hope this website can actually show you guys who I really am.

    </p>
